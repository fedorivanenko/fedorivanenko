## ðŸ‘‹ Code Partner for Web Design Studios

I help branding and web design studios turn their visual identities into high-performance marketing websites â€” built with `next.js`, `tailwind-css`, and `framer-motion`. 

Every build is custom, fast, responsive, and animated with nuance â€” so your designs look and feel exactly the way you envisioned them, live in the browser.

### What I Do

- Frontend development for brand/marketing sites using `next.js`
- Figma-to-production implementation
- Responsive, accessible, lightning-fast builds
- Micro-interactions & motion design â€” `framer-motion`
- CMS integration â€” `sanity.io` / `basehub.com` / `markdown`
- Hosting & deployment â€” vercel, neon, etc.

### Why Work With Me

- I deliver results
- I speak design fluently (12 years of design experience)
- I make websites easy to update and maintain
